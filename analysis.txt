O, Ω, Θ are not best or worst case:
  They are the bounds of the runtime functions derived from the algorithm
  Each notation can be applied to Best Case, Worst Case, and Average case

Worst Case Runtime
  runtime complexity for an input that results in the longest execution.

Find a function, f, of input, N, that represents the number of operations in the worst case:
  f(N) = 3N + 3
Reduce to big O
  O(3N + 3) = O(N)

Best-Case Runtime
  runtime complexity for an input that results in the shortest execution

Average Case
  Calculate the expected value of inversions
  Example: Insertion Sort
    Inversion, I,  means the pair of numbers are out of order
    total number of pairs is n(n-1)/2
      sum of natural numbers because each element has decreasing unique pairs after previous number pairs are counted
    probability of inversion is assumed 50 (random)
    E[I] is Σ(everypair) * 1/2 
      which is n(n-1)/2 * 1/2
      which is n^2
    So the expected number of inversions is n^2, thus Average Case is n^2
