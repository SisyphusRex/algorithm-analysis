O, Ω, Θ are not best or worst case:
  They are the bounds of the runtime functions derived from the algorithm
  Each notation can be applied to Best Case, Worst Case, and Average case

Worst Case Runtime
  runtime complexity for an input that results in the longest execution.

Find a function, f, of input, N, that represents the number of operations in the worst case:
  f(N) = 3N + 3
Reduce to big O
  O(3N + 3) = O(N)

Best-Case Runtime
  runtime complexity for an input that results in the shortest execution
