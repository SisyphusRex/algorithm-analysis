## Arithmetic
Sequence of numbers in which each successive term is a sum of its preceding term and a fixed number.  
a, a+d, a+2d, ...
### Sum of Natural Numbers
$`(N-1) + (N-2)+...+2+1=\frac{N(N-1)}{2}`$  

## Geometric
Each term is x times the previous term
a, ar, ar^2, ar^3
$`H(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty }x^{j}=\frac{1}{1-x}`$
